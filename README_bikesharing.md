# Project Name
Bike Sharing Assignment


# Problem Statement:
BoomBikes, a US-based bike-sharing provider, has faced substantial revenue declines amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The company is grappling with sustainability challenges in the current market conditions. In an effort to revitalize its business, BoomBikes aims to anticipate the demand for shared bikes once the quarantine situation subsides nationwide. The goal is to proactively position themselves to meet heightened demand, distinguish their services in the market, and generate significant profits.

# Objectives:
Identify the key variables that significantly influence the prediction of bike demand. Assess the effectiveness of these variables in describing and predicting the demand for shared bikes.

# Goal:
Develop a predictive model that identifies the significant variables influencing bike demand. This model will serve as a valuable tool for the management to comprehend the factors driving demand and strategically manipulate business tactics. The ultimate aim is to align services with anticipated demand levels and exceed customer expectations, thereby fostering profitability and sustained success.



## Conclusions
Seasonal Impact: Seasonal variables (season_spring and season_winter) influence bike demand, with a slight decrease in spring and a modest increase in winter.

Weather Sensitivity: Weather-related variables (temp and weathersit_light_snow) significantly affect bike demand, positively with higher temperatures and negatively with light snow.

Yearly Growth: The positive yr coefficient suggests a trend of increasing demand over the years, potentially driven by growing awareness of bike-sharing services.

Holiday Effect: The negative holiday coefficient indicates a minor dip in predicted demand during holidays, allowing tailored strategies for holiday seasons.

Weekday and Monthly Variations: Specific weekdays (weekday_sun) and months (mnth_sep) impact demand uniquely, suggesting targeted strategies for Sundays and September promotions.
